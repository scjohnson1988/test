### UPDATED NOTES ###
Before we do anyhting, at the top of his pipeline, I see before_script: cp /etc/gitlab-runner/certs/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/update-ca-certificates.  I'd very that certificate is correct.  This is the 'job' container usering imaage: docker:latest.  

I THINK the issue is actually the other container.  I THIIIINK the Service Container (docker:dind) is NOT trusting CA.  Here's my best guess.

We will want to add these two to the volumes to the runner.toml:
      # mount CA for docker daemon dind service for our internal registry.  Docker Daemon prefers a bundle.
      "/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/a2i2-bundle.crt:/etc/docker/certs.d/registry.a2i2-gitlab.761link.net/ca.crt:ro",
      # Mount CA for Git/Curl on the Job Container.  If this fails, split it into individual certs and move it to something like: /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/a2i2-root.crt (and repeat for int.crt)
      "/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/a2i2-bundle.crt:/tmp/a2i2-bundle.crt:ro"

For the certificate itself, I wanna say it looks like we can use a chain like this:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
int ca here
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
root CA here
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

If not, or if you want to be safe, you can make 

Go to the ci yml.
What I am NOT 100% sure on is if we should set this back to whatever it was, like: DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs".  I'd run it first as-is with "".

Edit the ci config to something like this:
before_script:
  # 1) add curl if needed. this is probably unnecessary, but the || true will skip it if it's there already.
  - apk add --no-cache curl || true

  # 2) Update OS certs
  # NOTE: I think the 'cp /etc/gitlab-runenr/certs/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ is not needed due to the mount bind
  # I think since we're going to try to append the certs to ca-certificates.crt, this update-ca-certifcates isn't really needed.
  # If this fails, we'll probably need to mount the root and int CA separately along with the bundle and store those in a way that update-ca-certificates will work
  - cat /tmp/a2i2-bundle.crt >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  - update-ca-certificates

  # 3) Verify - expect a 200 or 401.  If SSL fails, look for an exit code.
  - echo "### DEBUG TRUST TEST ###"
  - curl -v https://registry.a2i2-gitlab.761link.net/v2/

  # 4) Leave everything else at the '| <line break> if ["$CI_JOB_STAGE"....' as-is.


#### ORIGINAL NOTES ###
Option 0.1) Sorry for the dumb number, too lazy to re-type it.  We should try using an older dind/docker version.

Option 0.2) Per this: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/tls-self-signed/#supported-options-for-self-signed-certificates  -- there is a config variable of 'GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY' that can be used.  Unsure if that would apply to the dind container though, but again, we hit that curl error on the runner's container outside of dind.

Option 0.3) Per the same URL: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/tls-self-signed/#supported-options-for-self-signed-certificates, they show this config:
[[runners]]
  name = "docker"
  url = "https://example.com/"
  token = "TOKEN"
  executor = "docker"

  # Copy and install CA certificate before each job
  pre_build_script = """
  apk update >/dev/null
  apk add ca-certificates > /dev/null
  rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

  cp /etc/gitlab-runner/certs/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt
  update-ca-certificates --fresh > /dev/null
  
Along with this: curl --cacert "${CI_SERVER_TLS_CA_FILE}"  ${URL} -o ${FILE}

Option 0.4 ) Per this, there is a variable of 'FF_RESOLVE_FULL_TLS_CHAIN'.  It looks like this may be disabled by default, but we can toggle off the feature flag.  I also think this issue is a step after the runner.    https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/feature-flags/


Option 1) Try to set TLS to ignore validation of the registry.  Some of the configs I got from AI, so I haven't cross-validated to ensure they actually exist.  Read comments next to each line below for details.  I wonder if we can make a new branch to test on his code?
# Example snippet of ci config:
services:
  - name: docker:xx-dind   # I'm not looking at his CI file, so this is probably already there.  Think this may also be 'docker:dind:'
#    command: ["--tls=false"]   # I believe this one fully disables TLS, so we don't want to do it
#    command: ["--insecure-registry=registry.a2i2-gitlab.761link.net"]  # This is the better route, as it would apply to a specific repo 
 
# Additional variables in the CI that may or may not be required  
variables:
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375   # Not sure if this is needed at all.
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""           # Not sure we need to set this, but we could probably comment this ouit.  Some examples had this, others had the one below with the CERTDIR and CERT_PATH
  DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY: 1             # Set to 0 to disable?
# DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"
# DOCKER_CERT_PATH: "$DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR/client"
 
 
# This a shorter example of a possible fix above 
variables:
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"   # Again, this path may need to be tweaked 
 
services:
  - name: docker:dind
    command: 
      - "--insecure-registry=registry.a2i2-gitlab.761link.net"
 
before_script:
  - |
    if [ "$CI_JOB_STAGE" != "sonar-analysis" ]; then
      # Wait for Docker daemon to be ready
      until docker info; do sleep 1; done
    fi
  # Everything below should be as-is.
  
  

Option 2) Similar to above, but this is to try to force an update of the cert store rather than ignore TLS.  Add this near the top on the ci yaml:
before_script:
  # Update CA certificates for Alpine
  - apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
  - update-ca-certificates
 
# Add this maybe? Not sure it's required.
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
 
 
 
 
Option 3) Similar to option 2, but add in some commands to try to update CA certificates within the CI container:
services:
  - name: docker:dind
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - |
        apk add --no-cache ca-certificates && 
        update-ca-certificates && 
        dockerd-entrypoint.sh || exit 

 
 
 
 
 

Option 4) Try an explicit mount of the certificate then update ca-certs.
# Add this to the toml.
   volumes = ["/certs/client", "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock", "/docker/cache", "/etc/gitlab-runner/certs:/etc/gitlab-runner/certs:ro"]
 
# As an aside, I've seen this config in the gitlab official docs:     volumes = ["/cache", "/path/to-ca-cert-dir/ca.crt:/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/ca.crt:ro"]
   
# Add this to the CI
 before_script:
     - cp /etc/gitlab-runner/certs/a2i2-gitlab.761link.net.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
     - update-ca-certificates






Option 5) HIGHLY unlikely this will work tbh.  Try the runners.docker.services in the config.toml.  This would apply to ALL tasks on this runner though, but we could make another runner on that server with a different name/tag to isolate it.  https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration/. We'd still want the certs mounted too:

  [[runners.docker.services]]
    name = "docker:dind"
    command = ["/bin/sh", "-c", "apk add --no-cache ca-certificates && update-ca-certificates && dockerd-entrypoint.sh || exit"]
	





Option 6) Least likely, but if it's a docker build instead of a pull, he can update the image with something like this to take the ca cert and force an update. Doubt this is worth exploring much tbh.
COPY ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.crt
RUN update-ca-trust extract



Remaining Questions/Comments/thoughts:
*There's an article here about self-signed certs, but I don't think anyhting listed isn't covered above: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/tls-self-signed/#troubleshooting
*There is a TLS tool here, but I didn't have it by default on my homelab runner (which is the free version and in a container itself): https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/runner-tools/tlsctl.  I got it setup (it's a go app, so I had to install the go packages on the runner), but I don't think it really does anything unique that we need.  
*Can we just use an entrypoint or a pipeline tweak to run 'update-ca-certificates' either via the dpkg or the command?  I have this listed above for a few options.
*The tls_verify in the runner.docker is only for the docker daemon verification; that isn't for trusting the TLS on the registry.  This is disabled by default and it shouldn't apply.
*Why did the curl fail on the first container I jumped it while it was running?  NOTE: I confirmed that we need to run 'docker ps' after we jump into the first docker container to view the 'dind'/internal container.  So why did that fail on the first container?
*This has info on DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: https://about.gitlab.com/blog/docker-in-docker-with-docker-19-dot-03/
*Have we tested other similar pipelines with dind to see if they work on runner2?  If so, I have a hard time understanding why we get the curl errors on those outer docker containers unless it runs a container outside of dind?
*I still think it's worth a few tests to see the name resolution and dumping the certificate the container sees.  Although from my home PC, I can go to 
*I'd like to save some notes when I have time on the various images, base os, etc. being used so I can test a few CA certificates/try to re-create it on my home gitlab instance.
*There is a 'tls_cert_path' for the runners.docker, but I think that's for the trust with docker, not the trust to the registry.
*Try this as a volume:  "/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/a2i2-gitlab.761link.net.crt:/certs/host:ro",       # Update the cert path to match whatever is in the toml already (the /certs/clients or whatever).
